# Imbalanced-Classification
In this project, the aim is to build a predictive model for determining the income level of a person.

## Details
This project gives a walk-through of different stages of the predictive analytics.</br>

<i>Data Loading</i> - The source of data could be a text file,csv,database connection</br>
<i>Exploratory Data Analysis </i>- Understanding the features by using histograms and plots and how the target is affected by the input features.</br>
<i>Handling of missing values</i>- The handling of missing data by imputation or using algorithms to predict the column values.</br>
<i>Data Cleaning</i> - Removing the null values from the columns or the column with major null values</br>
<i>Factor Analysis</i> - Maintaining the same factor levels in train and test data and combine the levels which are having very less data </br>
<i>Feature Selection</i> - Selecting feature which are important for model building using chisquaretest.</br>
<i>Feature Conversion</i> - Converting features in number format for the model. </br>
<i>Model Building</i> - Training the model by balancing the data using sampling techniques.</br>
<i>Evaluatong Model Performance</i> - Data is imbalanced data set hence using evaluation metric like recall and precision.</br>
